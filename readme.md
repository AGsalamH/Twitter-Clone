### Twitter Clone
-----------------
##### For the sake of practicing

- First i'm Gonna make everything in one controller just to see how things work 
- then, i'm gonna separate all the logic in multiple controllers
each controller responsible for a specific logic.

- PLAN CHANGED

- i'm gonna do it inspired by Django architecture
    - using the `apps` concept
    - Each app is independent component and contains its [routes, controllers, models] inside of it.


##### Packages used
