### Twitter Clone
-----------------
##### For the sake of practicing

- i'm trying to do it inspired by Django architecture
    - using the `apps` concept
    - Each app is an independent component and contains its [routes, controllers, models] inside of it.


##### Packages used yet
- express
- mongoose
- jsonwebtoken
- dotenv
- bcryptjs


##### TODO:
- Fix tweets actions to work with the new Tweet Model
- Upload images
- Feed
- DM app
